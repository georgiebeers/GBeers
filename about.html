            <h2>Georgiana Beers</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Georgiana Beers and I am a student at Gonzaga University studying Business Administration with a concentration in Management Information Systems. I am also minoring in Sport Management as I have grown up playing sports and have a passion for it. I am from Olympia, Washington and enjoy spending a lot of my time outdoors or with friends and family. I grew up playing sports and being with my friends which is why I think I have always had love for all sports and feel so passionate about them.</p>
